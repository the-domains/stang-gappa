While these challenges may not become fully realized, it can be certain that a distinct aspect of each one will require thoughtful and diligent consideration over the next five years when planning a marketing strategy.  The top five challenges confronting marketing managers in the immediate future include staying on top of changing marketing trends, training and talent acquisition of the marketing team, creating a digital strategy that stands out, communicating a return-on-investment (ROI), and the increasingly aggressive nature of competition. </p><h2>1.  Staying on top of changing marketing trends </h2><p>One of the most important challenges marketing managers need to consider is developing a strategy that is flexible enough to adapt to changing marketing trends.  <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/">According to Pew Research, “64% of American adults now own a smartphone of some kind, up from 35% in the Spring of 2011.”</a>[1]  As more and more people start to use their mobile device as their primary access point to the internet, marketing trends (such as having an optimized website) have evolved as rapidly as the technology trends themselves.  The increase in smartphone usage is one very small example of how marketers must adapt to the changing nature of the market. </p><h2>2.  Training and talent acquisition </h2><p>Concurrently, talent acquisition and training will pose a significant challenge to marketing managers due to the aforementioned change in marketing trends.  Marketing managers must ensure that their team is capable of championing new marketing trends as they come to fruition.  Consistent employee training opportunities of new technologies will be a vital necessity for marketing teams as new trends unfold.  <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3043109/sector-forecasting/25-predictions-for-what-marketing-will-look-like-in-2020">As Jeff Beer, senior Writer of Co.Create said, “The proliferation of channels, markets, and incomes in emer</a>ging markets around the world has made marketing a complex discipline.”[2]   There is no reason to safely assume that the job of a marketer will decline in sophistication. </p><h2>3.  Creating a digital strategy that stands out </h2><p>In addition, creating a digital marketing strategy that stands out will be a very difficult undertaking for marketing managers in the next five years.  According to Bradley Jones, author of Web 2.0 Heroes, “About 2 million to 3 million blog posts are published everyday.” (Jones, 67).[3]   This vast breadth of content has flooded the internet on every topic imaginable.  Proponents of digital and inbound methodology must recognize that the rapid adoption of content marketing demands a unique and thorough approach. </p><h2>4. Communicating a Return-on-Investment (ROI)  </h2><p>Simultaneously, communicating the ROI from inbound marketing strategies will continue to prove difficult to marketing managers.<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33820/5-Major-Challenges-Marketers-Face-And-How-to-Solve-Them.aspx">  Lindsey Kolowich, senior blogger at HubSpot, asserts that 71% of companies with more than 201 employees view proving the ROI of marketing activities as their biggest challenge.[4]</a>  As new marketing trends continue to arise, marketing managers must meticulously link them to the company’s bottom line in order to communicate the effectiveness of new strategies and tactics. </p><h2> 5. The increasingly aggressive nature of competition </h2><p>Finally, while it may be cliché, the the increasingly aggressive nature of competition will continue to plague marketing managers just as it has in the past.  Globalization has opened the proverbial doors for an unprecedented amount of competition worldwide.  As technology becomes cheaper and more easily accessible, competition will continue to emerge from countries that were recently unable to enter certain markets.  While the age-old debate about globalization continuing to create exponential sources of competition survives, <a href="http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/smartin/vita/cp5.pdf">Steven Martin, Economics Professor at Purdue University, succinctly concludes that, “Competition in the sense of rivalry seems clearly to promote efficient operations and productivity growth” (Martin, 50).[5]</a>   It is paramount that marketing managers concentrate their future strategies on efficiency in order to lead in an increasingly aggressive competitive landscape. </p><p>Although these trials may not become fully realized, marketing managers should carefully address each one in the marketing planning process.  Creativity and commitment when facing the challenges of changing marketing trends, training and talent acquisition of the marketing team, drafting a digital strategy that stands out, communicating a return-on-investment (ROI), and the increasingly aggressive nature of competition will yield results that only time can validate. </p><p> -Stang Gappa </p><p>[1] <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015</a>
